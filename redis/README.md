Volume Initialization
=====================

Ready to run, image creates reasonable config and relevant directories on
first run. If you link to a volume, data values will be stored between
executions, otherwise, data values will be lost when container is rebooted.

One may optionally create/modify the config file in VOLUME/etc/redis.conf
