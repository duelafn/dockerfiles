Volume Initialization
=====================

Just run container. There are helper scripts in the `bin` folder which will
mount a volume in the container for each directory path containing a file
argument. These scripts are still beta, but work in many cases.


Volume Layout
=============

VOLUME: /opt/mkvtoolnix


Docker Scripts
==============

    docker run  ... /docker/run
    docker exec ... /docker/stop
